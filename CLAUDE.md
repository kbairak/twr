- run the tests after each change to the code, command is `uv run pytest`. only run the tests when the code that the tests actually cover is changed
- you can connect to the database with `PGPASSWORD=twr_password psql --host 127.0.0.1 twr twr_user`
- uv run pytest can fail because of tetcontainers/macos issue. If this happens, simply rerun the tests
- prefer `uv run src/twr/reset.py` to `uv run src/twr/migrate.py` or `uv run python -m twr.migrate`
- tests use testcontainers and run the migrations every time, you don't have to run `reset` before running tests or check the database to see what the tests have to work with
