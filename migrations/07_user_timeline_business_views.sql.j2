    -- Returns: Aggregated portfolio metrics across all products for each (user, timestamp)
    -- Performance: Densifies user-product data then aggregates with simple GROUP BY
    -- Note: Densification ensures all products appear at all timestamps for complete portfolio values
    -- Parameters:
    --   - p_user_id: Filter by user (NULL = all users)
